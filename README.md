# CrossingRoad

Implemented in the UNITY videogame engine and in C#.

It is inspired by the videogame "Cross the street", in this case, I did it inspired by my homeland which is the eastern plains in Colombia. A cow must cross a busy avenue in order to eat flowers in order to eat flowers and earn points.

The SINGLETON design pattern was used.

I won a prize!
